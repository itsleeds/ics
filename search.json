    "text": "1 Summary of Impact\nThe development of open-source tools and methodologies for strategic active travel network planning has changed transport planning practices internationally. This report summarises the impact of a suite of tools that build on the foundational research of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT). These tools are now used by local and regional authorities worldwide to inform investment decisions in cycling and walking infrastructure.\n\n\n2 Underpinning research\nThe research underpinning these tools addresses several limitations of earlier models. Key developments include:\n\nThe Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT): The original tool for cycle network planning in England and Wales. See the PCT impact report for more details.\nCRUSE (Cycle Route Uptake & Scenario Estimation): Developed to estimate cycling potential for all trip purposes, now in use across the Republic of Ireland.\nbiclaR: A cycle network planning tool for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, which includes methods for calculating cycling potential to public transport links.\nThe Norwegian Propensity to Cycle Tool: An adaptation of the PCT methodology for Trondheim and Nord-JÃ¦ren.\nNetwork Planning Tool for Scotland: A web-based application to support strategic cycle network planning in Scotland.\n\n\n\n3 References to the research\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Details of Engagement\nEngagement for this project has involved desk-based research and stakeholder interaction to understand the real-world application of these tools. Key activities included:\n\nStakeholder Identification and Scoping\nSurvey Development and Feedback\nSystematic Review of Planning Documents\nData Integration and Analysis\n\n\n\n5 Details of the impact\nThe analysis of planning documents and other sources provides clear, quantifiable evidence of the significant impact of these tools on transport policy and infrastructure investment.\nThe Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a foundational tool for active travel planning in the United Kingdom. Analysis of 94 Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIPs) reveals that 95.7% of local and regional authorities now use the PCT to inform their investment decisions. The tool is consistently used for strategic network planning, identifying desire lines, and forecasting future cycling demand. This widespread adoption demonstrates the PCTâs significant impact on shaping transport policy and directing investments into cycling and walking infrastructure. Reports from authorities such as the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Oxfordshire County Council, Portsmouth City Council, Cumbria County Council, and Durham County Council show the PCT is used to identify âdesire lines,â model future scenarios (e.g., âGo Dutchâ), and justify investment decisions. See the PCT impact report for more details. The tool is heavily used, with 5.2k active users tracked on Google Analytics in the last year (to July 2025).\nThe CRUSE tool for Ireland extends the PCT methodology by incorporating all trip purposes, not just commuting and school travel. This provides a more comprehensive estimate of cycling potential. As described in the official documentation, âThe tool can be used to visualise and assess current patterns of cycling and how these could change in future, under scenarios of increased cycling uptake.â\nThe biclaR tool for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area is another evolution of the PCTâs methods. It is an online tool for the âdesign and assessment of different scenarios of the cycling network models in the Lisbon metropolitan area (LMA)â and notably includes the calculation of cycling potential to public transport links, addressing a key limitation of earlier models.\nBuilding on the PCT, the Norwegian adaptation models cycling potential in Trondheim and Nord-JÃ¦ren. The tool has been used by the regional transport planning authority to prioritise investments. Details TBC from Ray Pritchard. This demonstrates the international applicability and adaptability of the underlying research and methods.\nThe Network Planning Tool for Scotland is a âweb-based application designed to support strategic cycle network planning and investment decisionsâ. This tool is primarily for use by Scottish local authorities and shows the continued development and specialization of the original PCT concepts for different national contexts. The tool is heavily used, with 2.4k active users tracked on Google Analytics in the last year (to September 2025).\n\n\n6 Sources to corroborate the impact\n\nCRUSE: Cycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation\nbiclaR: Strategic Cycle Network Modelling for Lisbon Metropolitan Area\nThe Norwegian Propensity to Cycle Tool\nNetwork Planning Tool for Scotland"

    "text": "1 Summary of Impact\nThe Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) has become a foundational piece of evidence for active travel planning across the United Kingdom. Analysis of 94 of collected Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIPs) reveals that 95.7% of local and regional authorities now use the PCT to inform their investment decisions. The tool is consistently used for strategic network planning, identifying desire lines, and forecasting future cycling demand. This widespread adoption demonstrates the PCTâs significant impact on shaping transport policy and directing investments into cycling and walking infrastructure.\n\n\n2 Underpinning research\nThe Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) for England and Wales has continued to be the main tool for cycle network planning in England and Wales, but has limitations that we have addressed in subsequent work. To tackle the issue that networks generated by the PCT were too sparse, due to use of population weighted centroids as the origin and destination points for trips, we developed a new method called âjitteringâ (Lovelace, FÃ©lix, and Carlino 2022). The PCT only considered trips for commuting and travel to school but transport planners require estimates of potential changes based on all trip purposes, leading to the development of new methods for simulating social, leisure and shopping trips and incorporating them into estimates of cycling potential in the CRUSE tool, which is now in use across the Republic of Ireland (Lovelace et al. 2024). To address the limitation that the methods omitted cycling as part of multi-modal journeys involving public transport, we worked with colleagues at the University of Lisbon to calculate cycling potential to public transport links (FÃ©lix, Moura, and Lovelace 2025).\n\n\n3 References to the research\n\n\nFÃ©lix, Rosa, Filipe Moura, and Robin Lovelace. 2025. âReproducible Methods for Modeling Combined Public Transport and Cycling Trips and Associated Benefits: Evidence from the biclaR Tool.â Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 117 (April): 102230. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2024.102230.\n\n\nLovelace, Robin, Rosa FÃ©lix, and Dustin Carlino. 2022. âJittering: A Computationally Efficient Method for Generating Realistic Route Networks from Origin-Destination Data.â Findings, April, 33873. https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.33873.\n\n\nLovelace, Robin, Joey Talbot, Eugeni Vidal-Tortosa, Hussein Mahfouz, Elaine Brick, Peter Wright, Gary OâToole, Dan Brennan, and Suzanne Meade. 2024. âCycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE): An Approach for Developing Strategic Cycle Network Planning Tools.â European Transport Research Review 16 (1): 55. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12544-024-00668-8.\n\n\n\n\n4 Details of Engagement\nEngagement for this project has involved from desk-based research of the LCWIPs to stakeholder interaction to build a comprehensive survey material for understanding of the PCTâs real-world application. Although the initial plan included the distribution of the finalised questionnaire to the stakeholders, the work scope was shifted more towards the continuation of the further detailed analysis over the database and automation of the data collection, which are expected to be applied to other tools in the future when possible. Key activities included:\nâ¢ Stakeholder Identification and Scoping: A typology of key stakeholders was created, covering transport planners, local authority representatives, and academic researchers. This was supplemented by an initial analysis of previous surveys to understand existing usage patterns and inform outreach.\nâ¢ Survey Development and Feedback: A draft online survey questionnaire was developed to capture quantitative and qualitative data on tool usage. This draft was shared with key stakeholders, and their feedback was incorporated to refine the questions, ensuring they were relevant to practitioners.\nâ¢ Systematic Review of Planning Documents: A database of 105 of initially collected LCWIPs was compiled and systematically analysed. This analysis formed the primary evidence base for the toolâs impact, with the intention to act as an additional efficient tool to user surveys to documented application.\nâ¢ Data Integration and Analysis: The final clean database of 94 LCWIPs was then merged with geographic boundary data and Active Travel Fund (ATF) allocation data. This created an integrated dataset allowing for spatial and financial analysis of the PCTâs influence.\n\n\n5 Details of the impact\nThe analysis of the documents provides clear, quantifiable evidence of the PCTâs significant impact on transport policy and infrastructure investment in the UK. The most significant finding is that 95.7% (90 out of 94) of the analysed LCWIPs explicitly mention using the Propensity to Cycle Tool as part of their walking and cycling infrastructure planning [1]. This demonstrates that the PCT has become one of the integral parts of the official government methodology for planning active travel networks. Reports from authorities such as the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority [2] and Oxfordshire County Council for Kidlington [3] show the PCT is used to identify âdesire lines,â model future scenarios (e.g., âGo Dutchâ), and at last justify investment decisions.\nIn addition, the evidence shows the PCT is not just mentioned but actively used to shape the design of cycle networks. Reports consistently cite the toolâs role in identifying key corridors, for an instance, in the Portsmouth LCWIP Background Report, the PCTâs âGovernment Targetâ scenario was used to identify the highest forecast future cycle commuting flows within the plan area, directly informing the selection of primary cycle ways [4]. In the Cumbria County Council reports for Carlisle [5] and Workington [6], the PCTâs âGo Dutchâ scenario outputs were used with the purpose to validate the desire lines that form the basis of their proposed networks.\nFinally, another significant evidence of impact can be found in the Durham County Council LCWIP report for Shildon, where PCT outputs were integrated directly into its prioritisation matrix, meaning the tool had a direct and quantifiable impact on which routes were selected for future investment [7].\n\n\n6 Sources to corroborate the impact\n[1] https://github.com/itsleeds/ics\n[2] https://api.liverpoolcityregion-ca.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/LCR-LCWIP-Final.pdf\n[3] https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/sites/default/files/file/roads-and-transport-major-projects/Kidlington_LCWIP.pdf\n[4] https://travel.portsmouth.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Background-Report.pdf\n[5] https://www.cumberland.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2025-04/carlisle_lcwip_technical_report.pdf\n[6] https://legacy.westmorlandandfurness.gov.uk/elibrary/Content/Internet/538/18110/38384/4481911413.pdf\n[7] https://democracy.durham.gov.uk/documents/s174868/Item%207%20Shildon%20LCWIP%20Final%20inc%20Appendices_opt.pdf"
